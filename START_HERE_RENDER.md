## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations:

1. **Spin Down**: App sleeps after 15min of inactivity
2. **Wake Up**: First request takes ~30 seconds
3. **RAM**: 512MB (enough for dashboard)
4. **Build Time**: 15 minutes max (yours builds in ~5min)

### To Keep Always-On:

Upgrade to paid tier ($7/month):
- Dashboard → Settings → Instance Type → Starter

---

## 🔄 Updating Your App

Every time you want to update:

```bash
# Make changes to your code
# Then:

git add .
git commit -m "Update: describe your changes"
git push
```

**Render automatically rebuilds and redeploys!** 🎉

No need to do anything on Render dashboard!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Failed?

**Check**: Render build logs for specific error

**Common fixes**:
1. Make sure `requirements-render.txt` exists
2. Check all files are pushed to GitHub
3. Verify Python version (should be 3.9.18)

### App Not Loading?

1. Check Render logs: Dashboard → Logs tab
2. Look for error messages
3. Verify start command includes `--server.port=$PORT`

### Still Having Issues?

Check files exist:
```bash
ls -la render.yaml
ls -la requirements-render.txt
ls -la app.py
```

All should exist ✅

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### About "KPIs Not Showing"

**This is NORMAL behavior**:

1. You click "Run Simulation"
2. Simulation runs for 20-30 seconds
3. During this time: **KPIs are blank** (simulation not done yet)
4. After completion: **KPIs populate with results**

**You must WAIT** for the simulation to finish!

**Look for**: 
- "Running simulation..." message
- Progress indicator
- "Simulation complete!" message

### About Icons/Emojis

**Browser Compatibility**:
- Some browsers don't show emojis in tab titles
- Icons might appear as boxes in some browsers
- **This doesn't affect functionality!**
- **All features work perfectly**

**Best Browser**: Chrome (best emoji support)

### About Free Tier

**Render Free Tier**:
- Spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First visit takes 30-60 seconds to wake up
- After that, works perfectly!
- **This is normal for free hosting**

**To avoid spin-down**: Upgrade to $7/month (always-on)
